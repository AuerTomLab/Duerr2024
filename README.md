### 1 Libraries & Installation
- Collection of all necessary installations to be done before using the scipts 
- Loads locations and necessary data into the work environment
- Load the libraries installed here in each Figure script


### 2 - Datasets Ours
- Here we apply CMTK Registration-files to each PN trace in our Dsec dataset 
- We also bridge the traces between brain reference spaces and mirror them as necessary
- We also relabel and export traces into folders which are used for generating Figure panels

### 2 - Datasets Others
- Here we query, sort and prepare datasets relevant for our analysis

### 3 - Glomeruli
- Here we demonstrated an workflow to use Glomeruli Annotations created with the [Microscopy Image Browser](http://mib.helsinki.fi) instead of AMIRA 

### 4 - ALPN Annotation
- Here we manually annotated neurons after using NBLAST

### Figures
- Here we combined all necessary code to reproduce R-based figure panels shown in the manuscript of Dürr et al. 2024
- We commented important sections to support readers
